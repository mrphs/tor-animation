Subtitles for KAJART's Tor animation
====================================

KAJART Design and Production, together with Nima Fatemi, made an awesome
animation that explains what Tor is.

This repository contains subtitles and possibly other resources for
translating the animation and recording translated voice-overs.


Translating subtitles
---------------------

We are going accept subtitles in any language, if we receive them no later
than May 31, 2015.  If you want to contribute subtitles in your language,
please follow these instructions:

 1. Copy the English subtitles file Tor_animation.en.srt to a new file
    with the ISO 639-1 language code of your language.

 2. Translate the text, not literally, but with focus on timing.  Native
    speakers of your language should be able to read your subtitles, and
    it should be possible to record your subtitles without rushing.  If
    that requires you to leave out a detail that you deem less important,
    that's okay.

 3. Once you're done, play the video with your subtitle file and see if
    you can follow the subtitles without trouble.  Adapt the translation
    as necessary.

 4. In some cases it's necessary to split up a subtitle, or better to
    merge two short subtitles into one.  If you don't know how to do that
    in the .srt file format, just mention the subtitles by number that
    you'd want to have split or merged, and we'll do that for you.

 5. Send your .srt file to tor-assistants@lists.torproject.org.  Let us
    know whether you're okay with being credited by name.


Recording voice-overs
---------------------

We are accepting recorded voice-overs if we receive them no later than May
31, 2015.  However, we can only accept recordings in the following
languages: Arabic, English, Farsi, French, German, Italian, Japanese,
Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.

The reason for this limitation is that processing contributed recordings
doesn't come for free.  If your language is not listed here, but you still
want us to include it, please consider finding a sponsor to cover the
processing fee and talk to us.

Please following these instructions for recording a voice-over:

 1. Find a quiet place for recording.  This can be any small room that
    doesn't echo your voice (like a bathroom) and that doesn't have
    background noise (like the refrigerator in the kitchen).  If there are
    people even in the room next to you, kindly ask them to leave or be
    very quiet for the time of recording.

 2. Make sure you can watch the animation, ideally with subtitles in your
    language, in a browser window or video player.  Find the mute button
    and mute the sound effects, so that they don't get recorded or confuse
    you.

 3. Find a microphone and an audio-recording software.  Most laptops and
    some headphones or even smartphones have reasonable microphones built
    in, and most operating systems come with their own audio-recording
    software.  When recording, make sure to keep a distance of 10 to 15 cm
    to the microphone.

 4. Consider printing out the translated subtitles, or make sure you can
    read them without using your keyboard or mouse, either of which would
    produce noise that could make the resulting audio file unusable.

 5. Hit record on the audio recorder.  A few seconds of silence at the
    beginning don't matter.  In fact, please record 20 to 30 seconds of
    the room sound, either at the beginning or at the end of the
    recording, so that the sound studio can better remove background
    noise.

 6. Start the animation.  Read the translated text whenever you see
    corresponding subtitles, or whenever you think the text matches the
    animation.  Go through the entire text until the animation is over.

 7. Hit stop on the audio recorder.  A few seconds of silence at the
    end don't matter.

 8. Repeat steps 5 to 7 until you're happy with the result.  It probably
    takes a couple of attempts to get the timing right.  This is fine,
    just repeat until you think you got everything right.  And maybe do it
    once more, just to be sure.

 9. Upload the last two or better three audio files and send links to
    tor-assistants@lists.torproject.org.  Let us know whether you're okay
    with being credited by name or not.
