1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,500
We've gotten very used to the Internet.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,700
We are constantly sharing information
about ourselves and our private lives:

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
food we eat, people we meet,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,200
places we go, and the stuff we read.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,400
Let me explain it better.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Right at this moment,
if someone attempts to look you up,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,200
they'll see your real identity,
precise location, operating system,

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,500
all the sites you've visited,
the browser you use to surf the web,

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,000
and so much more information
about you and your life

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,500
which you probably didn't mean
to share with unknown strangers,

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,000
who could easily use this data
to exploit you.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
But not if you're using Tor!

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,800
Tor Browser protects our privacy
and identity on the Internet.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,800
Tor secures your connection
with three layers of encryption

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,300
and passes it through three voluntarily
operated servers around the world,

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,500
which enables us to communicate
anonymously over the Internet.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,400
Tor also protects our data

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,600
against corporate or government targeted
and mass surveillance.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Perhaps you live in a repressive country
which tries to control and surveil the Internet.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Or perhaps you don't want big corporations
taking advantage of your personal information.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,500
Tor makes all of its users
to look the same

22
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,800
which confuses the observer
and makes you anonymous.

23
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,700
So, the more people use the Tor network,
the stronger it gets

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,800
as it's easier to hide in a crowd
of people who look exactly the same.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,500
You can bypass the censorship
without being worried about

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,100
the censor knowing what you do
on the Internet.

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,200
The ads won't follow you
everywhere for months,

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,300
starting when you first
clicked on a product.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,300
By using Tor, the sites you visit
won't even know who you are,

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
from what part of the world
you're visiting them,

31
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,700
unless you login and tell them so.

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,500
By downloading and using Tor,

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,000
you can protect the people
who need anonymity,

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,500
like activists, journalists and bloggers.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Download and use Tor! Or run a relay!
